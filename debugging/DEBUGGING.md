# Debugging Analysis

## Scenario 1: **Routing Logic Debugging**

- **Breakpoint Location:** `src/routes/user.js:45`
- **Objective:** Investigating why the user data endpoint is returning `404` instead of the expected `200`.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:** 
  - `req.params.id = 3`  
  - `user = null`  
  - `response.status = 404`

- **Call Stack:** 
  - `server.js: initializeServer() -> userRouteHandler() -> getUserById() -> response.send()`
  
- **Behavior:** 
  - The `getUserById()` function is called, but instead of returning the correct user data, the `user` object is `null`, which leads to a `404` response being sent.

### Analysis

- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - The route handler correctly received the `id` parameter, but the database query in `getUserById()` didn't return any results for `id = 3`.

- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior? If so, what might be the cause?**
  - Yes, the expected user data was not retrieved. The cause was a typo in the database query filter condition, where `user_id` was used instead of the correct `id`.

- **Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?**
  - Refactor the database query to ensure it uses the correct column name and add logging for when no user is found to assist with future debugging.

- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
  - It emphasized the importance of accurate query conditions and logging to trace issues with data retrieval.

## Scenario 2: **Endpoint Behavior Debugging**

- **Breakpoint Location:** `src/controllers/productController.js:72`
- **Objective:** Investigating why the `/products` endpoint is not returning the expected list of products.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:** 
  - `req.query.category = 'electronics'`  
  - `products = []` (empty array)
  
- **Call Stack:** 
  - `server.js: initializeServer() -> productsRouteHandler() -> getProductsByCategory() -> response.send()`
  
- **Behavior:** 
  - The request is correctly receiving the category query parameter (`electronics`), but the `getProductsByCategory()` function returns an empty array instead of a list of products.

### Analysis

- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - The query in the `getProductsByCategory()` function wasn't filtering the products by the correct category, causing the empty array to be returned.

- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior? If so, what might be the cause?**
  - Yes, the expected list of products wasn't returned. The root cause was that the query used for filtering was incorrectly matching an incorrect column (`category_id` instead of `category_name`).

- **Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?**
  - Refactor the query to filter based on `category_name` and ensure the database schema is consistent with the query parameters. Also, introduce validation to ensure the query parameter is valid.

- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
  - This scenario helped reinforce the need for careful handling of query parameters and the consistency of the database schema to avoid issues like this.

## Scenario 3: **Test Execution Debugging (Jest Test)**

- **Breakpoint Location:** `tests/user.test.js:32`
- **Objective:** Investigating why the Jest test for user registration is failing, specifically the part where the API returns an error message.

### Debugger Observations

- **Variable States:** 
  - `response.status = 400`  
  - `response.body = { error: 'Email already taken' }`  
  - `userData = { email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123' }`

- **Call Stack:** 
  - `test.js: registerUserTest() -> registerUser() -> userExistsCheck() -> response.sendError()`
  
- **Behavior:** 
  - The test case checks if the email is already taken, and the response returns a `400` error with the message `Email already taken`.

### Analysis

- **What did you learn from this scenario?**
  - The test case was correctly designed, but the issue stemmed from the fact that the test was running on a live database where the email was already taken. It wasn't a bug in the logic, but rather a state issue in the test environment.

- **Did you observe any unexpected behavior? If so, what might be the cause?**
  - The behavior was expected given the test setup, but the error occurred because the test was running against production data. A mock database or resetting the state before each test could help prevent this issue.

- **Are there areas for improvement or refactoring in this part of the code?**
  - Use a mock database or a test-specific database environment to ensure tests run with isolated data. Also, ensure test data is reset or cleared after each test run.

- **How does this enhance your understanding of the overall project?**
  - It highlighted the importance of isolating test data from production data and the impact of state management in automated tests.
